# Oracle Server Configuration

# Below is the list of default configuration for oracle server:
logLevel: 3  # Logging verbosity: 0: NoLevel, 1: Trace, 2: Debug, 3: Info, 4: Warn, 5: Error
gasTipCap: 1000000000  # 1GWei, the gas priority fee cap for oracle vote message which will be reimbursed by Autonity network.

#Set the buffering time window in blocks to continue vote after the last penalty event. Default value is 86400 (1 day).
#With such time buffer, the node operator can check and repair the local infra without being slashed due to the voting.
#This is important for node operator to prevent node from getting slashed again.
voteBuffer: 86400  # Buffer time in seconds (3600 * 24)

#Set oracle server key file.
keyFile: "./UTC--2023-02-27T09-10-19.592765887Z--b749d3d83376276ab4ddef2d9300fb5ce70ebafe"

#Set the password to decrypt oracle server key file.
keyPassword: "123%&%^$"  # Password for the key file

#Set the WS-RPC server listening interface and port of the connected Autonity Client node.
autonityWSUrl: "ws://localhost:8546"

#Set the directory of the data plugins.
pluginDir: "./plugins"  # Directory for plugins

#Set the profiling report directory, where some runtime state will be saved at.
profileDir: "."  # Profile directory

#Set the confidence strategy, available strategies are: 0: linear, 1: fixed.
confidenceStrategy: 0  # 0: linear, 1: fixed

#Set the plugin configs.
# The forex data plugins are used to fetch realtime rate of currency pairs:
# EUR-USD, JPY-USD, GBP-USD, AUD-USD, CAD-USD and SEK-USD from commercial data providers. There are 4 implemented forex
# data plugins, each of them requires the end user to apply for their own service key from the selected data provider.
# The selection of which forex data plugin(s) to use is for the end user to decide. The user can use any one of them,
# or he/she can use multiple forex data plugins in the setup.
#
# The crypto data plugins are used to fetch market prices for the crypto currency pairs: ATN-USDC, NTN-USDC, NTN-ATN and
# USDC-USD. USDC liquidity is bridged to the Autonity public testnet from the Polygon Amoy testnet via a bridge service.
# Out-the-box plugins for collecting ATN-USDC and NTN-USDC market data are available for UniSwap V2 and AirSwap protocols.
# NTN-ATN market price is derived from that market data, and USDC pricing is converted to USD. ATN-NTN, ATN-USD, and
# NTN-USD prices are then submitted on-chain. To retrieve ATN and NTN prices, put the `crypto_uniswap` plugin in your plugin directory.
# Oracle server can then discover and load them. Configuring the `crypto_uniswap` plugin does not require an API key,
# it is an open and free data source of a standard EVM RPC websocket service endpoint. The end user can connect to specific
# EVM RPC endpoint base on the blockchain which hosts the uniswap contract.

# USDC-USD prices are required by the protocol to convert the ATN-USDC and NTN-USDC to ATN-USD and NTN-USD. This enables
# the reporting of ATN and NTN prices in USD to the ASM. Three plugins are implemented to source the USDC-USD datapoint
# from open and free data sources: coinbase, coingecko, and kraken. To prevent single data source failure, putting all
# 3 plugins of CEX into your plugin directory is recommended. Oracle server can then discover and load them.
# You don't need to configure the CEX plugins (crypto_coinbase, crypto_coingecko, crypto_kraken) in your oracle server
# plugin configuration file.

# For the forex data plugin default configuration is set, so the end user just needs to configure required settings,
# namely `name` and `key`. The configuration settings of a plugin are:
#

# // PluginConfig carry the configuration of plugins.
#  type PluginConfig struct {
#  Name               string `json:"name" yaml:"name"`                         // the name of the plugin binary.
#  Key                string `json:"key" yaml:"key"`                           // the API key granted by your data provider to access their data API.
#  Scheme             string `json:"scheme" yaml:"scheme"`                     // the data service scheme, http, https, ws or wss.
#  Endpoint           string `json:"endpoint" yaml:"endpoint"`                 // the data service endpoint url of the data provider.
#  Timeout            int    `json:"timeout" yaml:"timeout"`                   // the timeout period in seconds that an API request is lasting for.
#  DataUpdateInterval int    `json:"refresh" yaml:"refresh"`                   // the interval in seconds to fetch data from data provider due to rate limit.
#  NTNTokenAddress    string `json:"ntnTokenAddress" yaml:"ntnTokenAddress"`   // The NTN erc20 token address on the target blockchain.
#  ATNTokenAddress    string `json:"atnTokenAddress" yaml:"atnTokenAddress"`   // The Wrapped ATN erc20 token address on the target blockchain.
#  USDCTokenAddress   string `json:"usdcTokenAddress" yaml:"usdcTokenAddress"` // USDCx erc20 token address on the target blockchain.
#  SwapAddress        string `json:"swapAddress" yaml:"swapAddress"`           // UniSwap factory contract address or AirSwap SwapERC20 contract address on the target blockchain.
#  Disabled           bool   `json:"disabled" yaml:"disabled"`                 // The flag to disable a plugin.
