# The forex data plugins are used to fetch realtime rate of currency pairs:
# EUR-USD, JPY-USD, GBP-USD, AUD-USD, CAD-USD and SEK-USD from commercial data providers.
# There are 4 implemented forex data plugins, each of them requires the end user to apply for their own service key from
# the selected data provider. The selection of the forex data plugin is on demand by end user. The user can use anyone
# of them, or he/she can use multiple forex data plugins in the setup.
#
# The crypto data plugins are used to fetch realtime rate of crypto currency pairs:
# ATN-USDC, NTN-USDC, NTN-ATN from exchanges. For Autonity Piccadilly Circus Games Competition Round 6 game, the data provider of these pairs is a simulated
# exchange that people can trade ATN and NTN in the markets created by it. Thus, there is no configuration required for
# the plugin named pcgc_cax that fetch data of crypto currency pairs, since the default configurations inside the plugin
# works for you.

# For each forex data plugin, there is a list of configuration are required, however most of them have use default
# configuration, thus, the end user just need to configure the required ones. All the configuration of a plugin is
# explained as below:
